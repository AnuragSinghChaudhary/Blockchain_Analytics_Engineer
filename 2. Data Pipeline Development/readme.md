#### 2. Data Pipeline Development

**Objective:**
- Build a scalable ETL pipeline using Apache Airflow and Spark.

**Steps:**
1. **Environment Setup:**
   - Set up Apache Airflow and Spark environments.
   - Configure connections to data sources and data warehouse (e.g., Snowflake, Redshift).

2. **Data Extraction:**
   - Define data sources (databases, APIs, file systems).
   - Develop extraction tasks in Airflow to pull data from these sources.

3. **Data Transformation:**
   - Implement transformation logic in Spark.
   - Apply data cleansing, aggregation, and enrichment operations.

4. **Data Loading:**
   - Load transformed data into the data warehouse.
   - Set up loading tasks in Airflow to ensure data consistency and integrity.

5. **Scheduling and Monitoring:**
   - Define Airflow DAGs (Directed Acyclic Graphs) to schedule ETL jobs.
   - Implement logging and monitoring for pipeline health and performance.

**Outcome:**
- A fully operational ETL pipeline that efficiently handles large datasets and loads them into a data warehouse.
