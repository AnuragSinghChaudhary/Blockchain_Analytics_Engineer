#### 5. Data Quality and Auditing Framework

**Objective:**
- Ensure high data quality and audibility of data pipelines.

**Steps:**
1. **Data Quality Metrics:**
   - Define data quality metrics (accuracy, completeness, consistency).
   - Set up data quality checks at various stages of the pipeline.

2. **Auditing Mechanisms:**
   - Implement logging mechanisms to track data transformations and movements.
   - Develop audit trails for key data processing steps.

3. **Monitoring and Alerts:**
   - Set up monitoring tools to track pipeline health and data quality.
   - Configure alerts for data quality issues and pipeline failures.

4. **Validation and Reconciliation:**
   - Implement validation checks to ensure data accuracy.
   - Develop reconciliation processes to verify data integrity.

5. **Documentation and Reporting:**
   - Document data quality checks and audit processes.
   - Generate regular reports on data quality and pipeline health.

**Outcome:**
- A robust framework ensuring high data quality and audibility for data pipelines.
