#### 3. Distributed Data Store Design

**Objective:**
- Design and implement a distributed data store using Hadoop or Cassandra.

**Steps:**
1. **Requirements Gathering:**
   - Identify data storage needs and access patterns.
   - Determine scalability, availability, and fault tolerance requirements.

2. **Technology Selection:**
   - Evaluate Hadoop and Cassandra based on requirements.
   - Choose the most suitable technology for the distributed data store.

3. **Implementation:**
   - Set up the chosen technology (Hadoop or Cassandra).
   - Configure clusters for high availability and fault tolerance.

4. **Data Migration:**
   - Plan and execute data migration from existing storage to the new distributed data store.
   - Ensure data integrity and consistency during migration.

5. **Validation and Optimization:**
   - Validate data store performance and scalability.
   - Optimize configurations for query performance and storage efficiency.

**Outcome:**
- A robust distributed data store serving as the central source of truth for the organization.
